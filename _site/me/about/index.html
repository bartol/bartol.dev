<p>Hey, my name is Bartol Deak. I’m High School student currently living in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zadar/">Zadar</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Croatia/">Croatia</a>. I started learning full stack web development last year and so far I’m enjoying it a lot.</p>
<p>Also, I value accessibility because making the web accessible for everyone is as valuable as making it fast and beautiful.</p>
