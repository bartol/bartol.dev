<p>Hey! Welcome to my blog! As this is my first post I traditionally named it Hello World. Very nerdy indeed. In this post I'll go over past, present and future of this blog.</p>
<h2>This is blog about programming. We gotta start with stack!</h2>
<p>As you probably imagined from JavaScript cool boy programmer, stack is pretty much bleeding edge.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a> to get these fancy static sites from <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://mdxjs.com">MDX</a>. For those who aren't living on the edge, MDX is kind of markdown on steroids. Imagine putting <code>&lt;FancyComponentDownloadedFromNpm /&gt;</code> inside your markdown text. That is MDX in nutshell.</p>
<p>Next, we have <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>. Algolia is really fast search. And it's easy to setup on static site. I've actually written post about Algolia integration with Gatsby that you can see <a href="https://bartol.dev/blog/algolia-search-gatsby/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that <a href="https://prismjs.com/">PrismJS</a> with <a href="https://github.com/SaraVieira/prism-theme-night-owl">Night Owl theme</a> (port from <a href="https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme">this</a> theme by <a href="https://github.com/sdras">Sarah Drasner</a>) is used for code highlighting and <a href="https://guess-js.github.io/">GuessJS</a> is used for pre-fetching pages with machine learning using data from Google Analytics. A lot of buzzwords, but it's really cool. Google talk about it can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/Mv-l3-tJgGk?t=2093">here</a>. I plan to write about it more soon.</p>
<h2>Enough about stupid tech stuff. What are you gonna post?</h2>
<p>For now I plan to post as frequently as I can, about things that I learn and use.</p>
<p>In following format:</p>
<h3>How to map over array in JavaScript</h3>
<p>...small description...</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token keyword">const</span> array <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'one'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'two'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line"></span><br><span class="highlight-line">array<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">map</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">item</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line">  console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>item<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line"></span><br><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token comment">// output:</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token comment">// one</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token comment">// two</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You can find ideas and plans for future posts on <a href="https://bartol.dev/roadmap/">/roadmap</a>. I'll do my best to keep it up to date.</p>
<h2>What about the future?</h2>
<p>For the near future, I plan to add few extra qualify of life features for readers and squash some bugs.</p>
<p>Aaand that was it! Be sure to take a look at <a href="https://bartol.dev/">my other posts</a>. Maybe you'll find something nice!</p>
