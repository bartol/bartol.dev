<p>I am sure there was at least one time you've wondered why does C have <code>i++</code> and <code>++i</code> operators. Me too. That's why I've made this article.</p>
<p><code>i++</code> is also called post Increment whereas <code>++i</code> is known as pre Increment and, as you probably already concluded, they both increment variable. Difference is in the value that it returns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Post increment (<code>i++</code>) returns the value, and then increments it.</li>
<li>Pre Increment (<code>++i</code>) increments the value, then returns it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is all there is to it!</p>
