<p>ESLint is probaby the best tool to improve quality of your JavaScript
code, but sometimes it just gets in the way. Also, I forget how to turn off
rule for a file and I've searched that more times than I would like to admit. Enough is enough, at least I'll know where to find it next time.</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token comment">/* eslint rule-name: 0 */</span></span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Keyword is actually <code>eslint</code>. I always remember <code>eslint-disable</code> or
<code>eslint-disable-file</code> and get frustrated because it doesn't work.</li>
<li>Double slash comments (<code>// ...</code>) can't be used here for some weird reason.
Learned it the hard way, multiple times.</li>
<li>If you are feeling particulary awesome today, you can increase number to <code>1</code>
for warning or <code>2</code> for error.</li>
</ul>
