<p>I'll start with a disclaimer. Whole idea and content from this article is heavily inspired by <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages">Semantic Commit Messages</a> post.</p>
<p>I am sure there was at least few times you were searching for something in <em>that</em> commit. And you couldn't find it in sea of other bug fixes, features and “codebase cleanups”.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to better (semantic) commit messages. All you need to do is prepend commit message with one of multiple prefixes like <code>feat</code> for feature of <code>fix</code> for, well, bug fix.</p>
<pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text"><span class="highlight-line">feat:       new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script</span><br><span class="highlight-line">fix:        bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script</span><br><span class="highlight-line">docs:       changes to the documentation</span><br><span class="highlight-line">style:      formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change</span><br><span class="highlight-line">refactor:   refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable</span><br><span class="highlight-line">test:       adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change</span><br><span class="highlight-line">chore:      updating dependencies etc; no production code change</span></code></pre>
<p>After using this system for a while, you'll be able to easily navigate through your Git history.</p>
