<p>Quick aside. After writing about common HTTP status codes the other day, I figured out that I should also write about common methods and headers. So here is methods part.</p>
<p>Methods <strong>indicate action</strong> that should be performed on resource.</p>
<h2>GET</h2>
<p>Requests specified resource. It should only retrieve data.</p>
<h2>POST</h2>
<p>Submits data to server. Often causing side effects like saving to database or similar.</p>
<h2>PUT</h2>
<p>Updates specified resource with data from request.</p>
<h2>DELETE</h2>
<p>Deletes specified resource.</p>
<h2>HEAD</h2>
<p>Same as GET, just response doesn't contain body.</p>
<p>There are others, but they are almost never used. You can learn about them on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">MDN</a>.
Also, there are new server architectures like <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> that use POST for everything. Seems like HTTP methods will be less and less important in the future. We'll see!</p>
