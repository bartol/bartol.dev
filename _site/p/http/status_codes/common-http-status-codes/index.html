<p>These are some of the most common HTTP codes that everyone working or building servers should know. Here is high level meaning of codes. I'll go more in depth later.</p>
<ul>
<li>1xx - Informational</li>
<li>2xx - Success</li>
<li>3xx - Redirect</li>
<li>4xx - Client Error</li>
<li>5xx - Server Error</li>
</ul>
<h2>2xx</h2>
<h3>200 OK</h3>
<p>The most common HTTP code, indicates success of request. Response may vary based on request method used.</p>
<h3>201 Created</h3>
<p>Means that request to create resource has been fulfilled.</p>
<h2>3xx</h2>
<h3>301 Moved Permanently</h3>
<p>This and all future request should be redirected to given URL.</p>
<h3>303 See Other</h3>
<p>When received as response from POST (or similar) request, client presumes that request was successful and redirects to given URL (using GET method).</p>
<h3>307 Temporary Redirect</h3>
<p>This request should be redirected to given URL but future requests should still use original URL.</p>
<h2>4xx</h2>
<h3>400 Bad Request</h3>
<p>Request can't be processed because of invalid request syntax, size, ...</p>
<h3>403 Forbidden</h3>
<p>Request is valid but server refuses action due to lack of necessary permissions for resource or invalid credentials. The request should not be repeated.</p>
<h3>404 Not Found</h3>
<p>The requested resource could not be found.</p>
<h3>429 Too Many Requests</h3>
<p>Used for rate limiting. User has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.</p>
<h2>5xx</h2>
<h3>500 Internal Server Error</h3>
<p>Generic error message that indicates error in request processing on server side.</p>
<h3>503 Service Unavailable</h3>
<p>Server cannot handle request due to overload or maintenance. Usually temporary.</p>
<p>There are much more status codes available, especially 4xx for all kinds of specific needs. I encourage you to learn more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
