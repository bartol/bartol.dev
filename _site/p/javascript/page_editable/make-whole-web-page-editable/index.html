<p>While randomly browsing reddit few days ago, I've found this really nice trick.
Have you ever heard of <code>contentEditable</code> attribute that you can put on div to
make it, well, editable? This so called <code>designMode</code> does it for an entire web
page. All you need to do is enable it from browser console.</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="highlight-line">document<span class="token punctuation">.</span>designMode<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"on"</span></span></code></pre>
