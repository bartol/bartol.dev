<p>I have just randomly discovered this awesome feature, so I figured out I'll share it. You can tab complete filename with <code>*</code> in it. It can also complete multiple filenames. For a quick example let's say you have <code>index.html</code>, <code>index.js</code> and <code>main.js</code> files in directory.</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="highlight-line">some_command *.js</span><br><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token comment"># will autocomplete to index.js main.js</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line"></span><br><span class="highlight-line">some_command ind*x.* <span class="token comment"># "*" can be inside filename</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token comment"># will autocomplete to index.html index.js</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is ZSH feature as far as I know. Fish shell probably also has it but I didn't have time to try. Bash can't do this autocompletion (tried on Ubuntu VPC).</p>
<p>Nice! Annoying typo led to (my) discovery of very useful feature.</p>
