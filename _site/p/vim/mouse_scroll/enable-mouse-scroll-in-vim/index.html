<p>After using Vim for about 10 or so days, one of the most annoying things was
mouse scroll. I was trying to not do it but sometimes my muscle memory would
just unconsciously do it. I would then find myself looking at half Vim window
and half my previous terminal commands. So, I decided to fix it.</p>
<pre class="language-vim"><code class="language-vim"><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token keyword">set</span> <span class="token builtin">mouse</span><span class="token operator">=</span>a</span></code></pre>
<p>After adding this line to your <code>vimrc</code> and sourcing it, your scroll will work
as expected. Still, consider using keyboard shortcuts for scroll, it's just
faster.</p>
<p>This setting was tested and works in Vim version <code>8.1</code> and NeoVim version
<code>0.4.2</code>.</p>
