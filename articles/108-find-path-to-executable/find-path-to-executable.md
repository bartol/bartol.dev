There are a lot of unix commands that can do this so it. It's
unnecessary confusing. Also, there is really, really long
[comment](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/85250) on StackExchange about
history of those commands that you can read if you're interested.

I'll just get to the point.

```sh
command -v executableName
/path/to/executable
```
