# What is Boolean algebra?

Boolean algebra is a system of algebra (named after the mathematician who studied it, George Boole) based on only two numbers, 0 and 1, commonly thought of as "false" and "true." Binary numbers and Boolean algebra are natural to use with modern digital computers, which deal with switches and electrical currents which are either on or off. (In fact, binary numbers and Boolean algebra aren't just natural to use with modern digital computers, they are the fundamental basis of modern digital computers.)
