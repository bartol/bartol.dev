# What is exponential notation?

Exponential or Scientific Notation is simply a method of writing a number as a base number times some power of ten. For example, we could write the number 2,000,000 as 2 x 10<sup>6</sup>, the number 0.00023 as 2.3 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, and the number 123.456 as 1.23456 x 10<sup>2</sup>.
