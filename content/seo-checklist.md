# SEO checklist

**Optimize content for your users, not search engines.**

1. Block unwanted crawling by using robots.txt (Don't let your internal pages be crawled)
2. See exactly how Googlebot sees and renders your website ([URL Inspection tool][1])
3. Create unique and descriptive page titles
4. Create description meta tag with summary of page content
5. Use headings to emphasize important text
6. Rich results ([Understand how it works][2], [Rich results gallery][3], [Structured data markup helper][4], [Rich results test][5])
7. Organize your site hierarchy (use breadcrumb if possible, make sure all the pages on your site are reachable through links and add sitemap for search engines)
8. Create 404 Not found page that kindly guides users back to a working page
9. Use descriptive (friendlier) URLs that convey content information
10. Provide one version of a URL to reach a document (If you do find that people are accessing the same content through multiple URLs setup 301 redirect or `rel="canonical"`)
11. Avoid embedding text in images and videos for textual content (users may want to copy and paste the text and search engines can't read it)
12. Write concise and descriptive link text
13. Combat comment spam with `rel="nofollow"` (will tell crawler that certain links on your site shouldn't be followed or pass your page's reputation to the pages linked to)
14. Use alt attribute on images
15. Make your site mobile-friendly ([Mobile-Friendly Test][6])
