<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	Hi, my name is Bartol and I enjoy programming.
	This website contains my knowledge base and some useful utilities.
	All content and website <a href="https://github.com/bartol/bartol.dev">source</a> is under
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#0-clause_license_(%22Zero_Clause_BSD%22)">BSD license</a>.
	There is no questionable privacy invading software installed on website.
	It's just simple Go http server serving files and rendering markdown.
	You can contact me via <a href="mailto:b@bartol.dev">email</a>.
