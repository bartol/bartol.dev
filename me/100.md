Time flies. I can't believe that this is my 100th post on this website. And I
managed to do it in just 100 days. I haven't missed a day.

I don't have much inspiration for writing right now, so I'll keep it very short.
My articles are relatively low effort, I paste some interesting code or
solution to a problem that I encountered at that time and write some (quite
poor) text around it. That is why I enjoy it so much. If I had to spend whole
day writing, there would be 3 posts instead of 100. Also, my point isn't to
explain you something in detail and with a bunch of examples. It's more like, I
solved this issue so here is solution for you and future me.
