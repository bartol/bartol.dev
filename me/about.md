Hey, my name is Bartol Deak. I’m High School student currently living in [Zadar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zadar/), [Croatia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Croatia/). I started learning full stack web development last year and so far I’m enjoying it a lot.

Also, I value accessibility because making the web accessible for everyone is as valuable as making it fast and beautiful.
