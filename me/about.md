Hey, my name is Bartol!

I'm high school student from [Croatia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Croatia/),
and over the past year or so I've been learning about web development so almost
all posts are about it.

Right now I am exploring worlds of lower level programming with Rust
programming language and building programs to automate and improve my everyday
life.

On this website I share my thoughts and notes.
