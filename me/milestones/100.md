Time flies. I can't believe that this is my 100th post on this website.
And I managed to do it in just 100 days. I haven't missed a day.

My articles are relatively low effort, I open new markdown file, paste
interesting code or solution to a problem that I encountered at that time
and write some (quite poor) text around it. That is why I enjoy it so
much. If I had to spend whole day writing, there would be 3 posts instead
of 100. Also, my point isn't to explain you something in detail and with
a bunch of examples. It's more like, I solved this issue so here is
solution for you and future me.
