## electricity

electricity - flow of charge

atomic number - number of protons in atom

electrons carry charge

Electrostatic Force

electric current

conductors - materials that don't hold tightly to their electrons

insulators - materials with low conductivity

static electricity

electricity "at rest", insulator prevents mixing 2 sides to balance system out

/slika/

when charges find way to equalize static discharge occurs, attraction becomes so
great that they can flow through insulators

example of static discharge: lightning

current electricity

in order to flow electricity needs never ending loop of conductive material

kinetic energy - energy in motion

potential energy - energy stored in object at rest

electric potential - amount of electric potential energy divided by the amount of charge

voltage is the difference in potential between two points in an electric field, it gives
us an idea of just how much pushing force an electric field has

charges are propelled by an electric field. We need a source of electric potential (voltage),
which pushes electrons from a point of low potential energy to higher potential energy.

Electricity wants to flow from a higher voltage to a lower voltage

convention is that current flows from + to - but current really flows from - to +,
as long as everyone uses the same convention, we can all build circuits that work just fine

- Voltage is the difference in charge between two points.
- Current is the rate at which charge is flowing.
- Resistance is a material's tendency to resist the flow of charge (current).

ohm's law: V = IR
power = P = VI

resistors

Variable Resistors (i.e. Potentiometers) - resistors which can be adjusted between a specific range of values

led current limiting

R = (Vs - Vf) / If

VS is the source voltage - usually a battery or power supply voltage.
VF and IF are the LED's forward voltage and the desired current that runs through it.

NPN: Not Pointing iN

semiconductor is a material that's not quite a pure conductor (like copper wire) but also not an insulator (like air).
