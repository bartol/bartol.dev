title: Difference between i++ and ++i in C

I am sure there was at least one time you've wondered why does C have `i++` and `++i` operators. Me too. That's why I've made this article.

`i++` is also called post Increment whereas `++i` is known as pre Increment and, as you probably already concluded, they both increment variable. Difference is in the value that it returns.

- Post increment (`i++`) returns the value, and then increments it.
- Pre Increment (`++i`) increments the value, then returns it.

And that is all there is to it!
