This might seem weird idea at first but hear me out.

There are quite a few pros of hosting google fonts.

## You have complete control over font.

Google fonts is known to push updates to fonts without notice. Although unlikely, that can mess up your whole website.

## Maybe you just don't like Google

There is movement against Google for privacy reasons that has been on rise lately.

## Okay, how you do it?

Lucky you. Someone has already done bulk of work for you. All you need to do is head over to [google web fonts helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) website and choose font you like. After that you'll need to specify font parameters and font is ready. Copy snippet in code and put files in project. Done!
