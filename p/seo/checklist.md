This checklist contains helpful SEO tips and some useful link. I use it day-to-day with my personal projects.

1. Block unwanted crawling by using robots.txt (Don't let your internal pages be crawled)
2. See exactly how Googlebot sees and renders your website

3. Create unique and descriptive page titles
4. Create description meta tag with summary of page content
5. Use headings to emphasize important text
6. Rich results (structured data markup)

   [Understand how structured data works](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data)

7. Organize your site hierarchy (use breadcrumb if possible, make sure all the pages on your site are reachable through links and add sitemap for search engines)
8. Create 404 Not found page that kindly guides users back to a working page
9. Use descriptive (friendlier) URLs that convey content information
10. Provide one version of a URL to reach a document (If you do find that people are accessing the same content through multiple URLs setup 301 redirect or rel="canonical")
11. Avoid embedding text in images and videos for textual content (users may want to copy and paste the text and search engines can't read it)
12. Write concise and descriptive link text
13. Combat comment spam with "nofollow" (Adding rel="nofollow" will tell Googlebot that certain links on your site shouldn't be followed or pass your page's reputation to the pages linked to)
14. Use "alt" attribute on images
15. Make your site mobile-friendly (And if you are using Responsive Web Design, use meta name="viewport" tag to tell the browser how to adjust the content)

### After creating site, you should analyze user behavior on it

- [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home)
- [Bing webmaster tools](https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster)

**Optimize content for your users, not search engines.** I can't emphasize this enough!
