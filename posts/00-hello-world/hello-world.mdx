Hey! Welcome to my blog! As this is my first post I traditionally named it Hello World. Very nerdy indeed. In this post I'll go over past, present and future of this blog.

## This is blog about programming. We gotta start with stack!

As you probably imagined from JavaScript cool boy programmer, stack is pretty much bleeding edge.

I used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) to get these fancy static sites from [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). For those who aren't living on the edge, MDX is kind of markdown on steroids. Imagine putting `<FancyComponentDownloadedFromNpm />` inside your markdown text. That is MDX in nutshell.

Next, we have [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Algolia is really fast search. And it's easy to setup on static site. I've actually written post about Algolia integration with Gatsby that you can see [here](https://bartol.dev/blog/algolia-search-gatsby/).

Other than that [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) with [Night Owl theme](https://github.com/SaraVieira/prism-theme-night-owl) (port from [this](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) theme by [Sarah Drasner](https://github.com/sdras)) is used for code highlighting and [GuessJS](https://guess-js.github.io/) is used for pre-fetching pages with machine learning using data from Google Analytics. A lot of buzzwords, but it's really cool. Google talk about it can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Mv-l3-tJgGk?t=2093). I plan to write about it more soon.

## Enough about stupid tech stuff. What are you gonna post?

For now I plan to post as frequently as I can, about things that I learn and use.

In following format:

**How to map over array in JavaScript**

...small description...

```JavaScript
const array = ['one', 'two']

array.map(item => {
  console.log(item)
})

// Output:
// one
// two
```

You can find ideas and plans for future posts on [/roadmap](https://bartol.dev/roadmap/). I'll do my best to keep it up to date.

## What about the future?

For the near future, I plan to add few extra qualify of life features for readers and kill some bugs.

Aaand that was it! Be sure to take a look at [my other posts](https://bartol.dev/blog/). Maybe you'll find something nice!
