File name completions in Vim is not built in feature, but it's very close.
It is from [netrw](/vim/netrw), file manager that comes with Vim. Completion
is accessible in **insert** mode with this shortcut:

```
Ctrl + x Ctrl + f
```

You can navigate list of options  with `Ctrl + n` for next and `Ctrl + p` for
previous option.
