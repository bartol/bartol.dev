For the past few months working more with React, almost every day I think how it would be great to have snippets for annoying repetitive tasks like outputting object as JSON in `<pre>` element. But code snippets always seemed a bit complicated, syntax wise. And I've been trying a lot of code editors this summer to find the one (spoiler: can't decide between VS Code and Vim) so this was only complicated my snippets game.

Randomly surfing the GitHub I've found [this awesome snippet generator](https://snippet-generator.app/).

You'll have to input snippet along with name and it will generate snippet for VS Code, Sublime and Atom with boilerplate. Just paste snippet in one of those editors and you are good to go!
