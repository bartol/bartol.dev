# Learn more about me...

My name is Bartol Deak. I'm 16 years old High School student currently living in [Zadar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zadar/@44.1349343,15.1788645,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4761fa62d2c0b88f:0x12323e1c13f40784!8m2!3d44.119371!4d15.2313648),

lot.

<br />

Right now I'm focused on learning front and back end technologies to build awesome websites.
I value accessibility because making the web accessible for everyone is as valuable
as making it fast and beautiful.
