# About me

Hi, my name is Bartol and I enjoy programming.
This website contains my knowledge base and some useful utilities.
There is no questionable privacy-invading software installed on website.
It's just simple Python web.py server rendering markdown posts behind Nginx reverse proxy.
You can contact me via [email](mailto:b@bartol.dev).
You can view my [dotfiles](https://git.bartol.dev/dotfiles), [scripts](https://git.bartol.dev/scripts),
[webshop](https://git.bartol.dev/amadeus2.hr) or this website [source](https://git.bartol.dev/bartol.dev).
