# About me

Hi, my name is Bartol and I enjoy programming.
This website contains my knowledge base and some useful utilities.
There is no questionable privacy-invading software installed on website.
It's just simple Python script generating html from markdown served by Nginx web server.
You can contact me via [email](mailto:b@bdeak.net).
