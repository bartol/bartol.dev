# Boolean algebra arithmetic operators

NOT takes one operand (that is, applies to a single value) and negates it: NOT 0 is 1, and NOT 1 is 0.

AND takes two operands, and yields a true value if both of its operands are true: 1 AND 1 is 1, but 0 AND 1 is 0, and 0 AND 0 is 0.

OR takes two operands, and yields a true value if either of its operands (or both) are true: 0 OR 0 is 0, but 0 OR 1 is 1, and 1 OR 1 is 1.

EXCLUSIVE OR, or XOR, takes two operands, and yields a true value if one of its operands, but not both, is true: 0 XOR 0 is 0, 0 XOR 1 is 1, and 1 XOR 1 is 0.
